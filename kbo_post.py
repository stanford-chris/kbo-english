Post English-language KBO League updates to Bluesky (@kbo-english.bsky.social).

Five post types:

  schedule   A pre-game thread: (1) tonight's matchups and start times (KST),
             with (2) the probable starting pitchers threaded underneath, each
             on its own card.
  live       A standalone box-score card posted as each game goes final,
             attendance-gated (held until KBO publishes that game's crowd
             figure). Polled through the evening; the results roundup below is
             the safety net for anything a poll misses.
  results    A nightly final-scores digest (every game's final in one post),
             then a compact box score threaded underneath per game that wasn't
             already posted live.
  standings  A rank / W-L / games-back table (from the KBO English site), posted
             each evening once the night's slate is final (polled, and gated so
             it holds until every game is in and skips off-days).
  leaders    A weekly season-leaders thread: a lead post, then one reply per
             leaderboard (top 5), romanised via the KBO English player pages.

Every post is a rendered PNG card, built by kbo_card via kbo_card_data. The post
text is the headline alone — the card carries the detail and its alt text
repeats that detail in full, so the information is never set twice in one post.
If a card fails to render the post falls back to the complete text body it used
before cards existed, which is why the compose_* functions still build one.

schedule/results/leaders draw their game and stat data from Naver Sports' public
API; standings and the leaders' name romanisation read the KBO English site.
schedule runs in the morning, results and standings in the evening once the
slate is final, leaders weekly on Monday (a league off-day). Dedup is by
(mode, date) in kbo_history.json, so each card posts at most once per day.

Data sources (unauthenticated JSON, KST timestamps):
    .../schedule/games?categoryId=kbo&fromDate=...   scores, matchups, times
    .../schedule/games/{gameId}/preview              probable starters (Korean)
    .../schedule/games/{gameId}/record               box score (line score, W/L/S)
    .../statistics/.../top-players?playerType=...     season stat leaders

Team names come from the stable 2-letter TeamCode (see TEAMS), never from the
API's TeamName field, which flip-flops between Korean and English. Starting
pitchers are posted in Korean unless the pcode is in kbo_roster.json; leaderboard
names are romanised from the KBO English player pages and cached into that same
table, falling back to Korean on a miss.

Requires (only for a real post, not --dry-run):
    pip install atproto
    security add-generic-password -a "kbo-english.bsky.social" -s "kbobot-bluesky" -w

Usage:
    python3 kbo_post.py schedule  --dry-run          # tonight's games (today KST)
    python3 kbo_post.py live      --dry-run           # games gone final since last poll
    python3 kbo_post.py results   --dry-run           # tonight's finals
    python3 kbo_post.py standings --dry-run            # tonight's table, if final
    python3 kbo_post.py standings --dry-run --date 2026-08-02   # a set date, ungated
    python3 kbo_post.py leaders   --dry-run           # season stat leaders
    python3 kbo_post.py results   --dry-run --date 2026-07-16
    python3 kbo_post.py results   --dry-run --all      # ignore history (re-show)
