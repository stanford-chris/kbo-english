"""
Build/refresh kbo_roster.json — a local pcode -> {name, foreign} table of
official English pitcher names, so kbo_post.py can romanize probable starters
without touching the KBO English site at post time.

How it works: it reads the probable-starter pcodes from Naver's game previews
for the target dates (default today + tomorrow, KST), and for any pcode not
already in the table, fetches that player's KBO English page once to read the
official English name and whether they're a foreign import (salary currency:
$ = import, ￦ = domestic). The table only ever grows, and only for pitchers who
actually start games — no full-league enumeration needed.

Run it on its own schedule (e.g. daily, well before the schedule post). If the
KBO site is unreachable, it simply adds nothing and exits cleanly; kbo_post.py
falls back to the Korean name for any pcode still missing, so the nightly post
never depends on this succeeding.

Names are stored raw (KBO's surname-first, ALL-CAPS surname form, e.g.
"KIM Min Jun"); kbo_post.py applies display ordering at read time.

Usage:
    python3 kbo_roster_build.py                 # today + tomorrow (KST)
    python3 kbo_roster_build.py 2026-07-17       # a specific date
    python3 kbo_roster_build.py 2026-07-17 2026-07-18
